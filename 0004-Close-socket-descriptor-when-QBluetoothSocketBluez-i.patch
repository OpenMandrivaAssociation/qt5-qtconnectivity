Subject: [PATCH 4/6] Close socket descriptor when QBluetoothSocketBluez is
 destroyed

There are two private QBluetoothSocket backends on Linux:
- QBluetoothSocketBluez is native linux socket implementation
  It is always used by the linux QBluetoothServer, and by
  QBluetoothSocket if Bluez version is < 5.46
- QBluetoothSocketBluezDbus used by QBluetoothSocket when
  Bluez >= 5.46

Leaving the native socket unclosed leaks the resource and eventually
we may run out of descriptors. This is reproducible by creating and
destroying QBluetoothServer instances in a loop.

As a related drive-by:
- Fix bluetooth socket autotest version check. DBus socket is used
  with bluez 5.46+ (for clarity: DBus lowenergycontroller
  is used with bluez 5.42+). This is needed for the test to pass
  with Bluez < 5.46
- Add a clarifying comment on socket close()

Fixes: QTBUG-103067
Pick-to: 5.15 6.2 6.3

* asturmlechner 2023-04-10: Drop conflicting drive-by fix in socket
  autotest - version check does not exist at least in 5.15.9.
